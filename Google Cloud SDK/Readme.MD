Your current project has been set to: [reactpageagent-1583c].

Not setting default zone/region (this feature makes it easier to use
[gcloud compute] by setting an appropriate default value for the
--zone and --region flag).
See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute section on how to set

Compute Engine API is enabled for your project on the
https://console.developers.google.com/apis page.
