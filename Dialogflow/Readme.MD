## Contexts
Connect intents - Contexts represent the current context of a user's request. This is helpful for differentiating phrases which may be vague or have different meanings depending on the userâ€™s preferences, geographic location, the current page in an app, or the topic of conversation. Contexts can be used to structure non-linear conversations. 
## Events
Trigger the intent from non-verbal signals - Events allow you to invoke an intent based on a non-verbal signal, such as a button click, or the start of a new conversation with a bot. Events can be used by external services to trigger Dialogflow intents, for example the Google Assistant's built-in intents.

## Actions and Parameters
[Extract the action and parameter](https://dialogflow.com/docs/intents/actions-parameters) - Parameters are specific values extracted from a user's request when entities are matched. The values captured by parameters can be used in fulfillment, or in building a response. If you mark parameters as required, Dialogflow will prompt the user if their values were not extracted from their initial request.
