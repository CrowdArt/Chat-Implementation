It always starts with intents. Intents are the trunking joints of the dialogue tree. It connects all of the branches. Intents determine where conversation will go and what an agent should do. In communication, intents can be thought of as the root verbs in the dialogue, such as wanting coffee translating to acquiring a beverage. Sometimes, being intents are not explicit and instead are inferred from the entire composition of a phrase. You want to map your intents to the goal of your obligation. If you're a help desk application, then your intents might include opening or filing a ticket, updating a ticket, closing a ticket. But your application may also need to access and update a user's account information, range over to a live technician, and even pass a longer quality assurance survey. Even affirmation, answering yes or no, is an intent. Intents evolve as your understanding of the users' needs evolves. You may find yourself doubling or tripling your intents beyond the draft side of intents. To make the task of defining intents easier, some rules of thumb can be applied. First, identify the verbs in the dialogue people will have with your agent. Doing that will allow your agent to have its actions mapped to needs from the user. Another possible scenario is to identify where the application should branch logic. Here's some examples. "Two mocha coffees please." "How many calories in a slice?" "I want a pizza" Or even, "I really need some caffeine." Once you have chosen your intents, you need to train your agent to recognize them. This can be done with the use of training phrases. The training phrases for each intent should be representative of how users manifest such intent. It is always a good idea to add variations to the grammatical construction of a request, using passive versus active voices, questions versus statements, and etc. When creating an intent, the more training phrases you can think of, the better. Later, we will discuss best practices for writing your training phrases. Let's do a quick activity. Can you come up with at least 10 different ways of ordering pizza? Your training phrases can be generic. I want a pizza. Which specific? Can I have a slice of pepperoni pizza? Needless to say, you could even add details such as the type of crust. It all depends on your use case. Take a few seconds to think about it. Here are some examples of additional training phrases. I will use these examples when I create my pizza-ordering intent in the Dialogflow console. Let's see how we can do that. All right. So, here's the dialogue for console. You can get here by going to console.dialogflow.com. As you can see, the left sidebar contains a menu with many options. I have already gone ahead and created my agent called agent one. Now, I'm ready to set up my intents. On the intents page, we can create new intents. By clicking create intent, we can choose a name for our intent. I'm going to choose order.pizza for the example we've been discussing. Scrolling down to the training phrases, click add training phrase. Here, you can enter the examples we've talked about. So, I would say, ''Can we have a pizza, please?'' Or, ''I would like to order a pizza now.'' Once you answered all of the training phrases, you can click the save button. You'll notice that the agent will start training once you introduce changes to it. If you want to test any other changes that you made, wait until the training is completed, and then test your agent. So, now, I'm going to go ahead and switch to another agent, which I have already added more training phrases, and that's agent two. So, if you see here, we have a larger list of training phrases that I entered and saved. I'm going to click save again, just to have my agent trained.
